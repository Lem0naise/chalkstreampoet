                I am a part-time primary school teacher, with experience of teaching both teaching KS1 and KS2, based in SW London. I am also a mother of four and a committed climate activist. I love to combine the science from my Geography Degree with my passion for art to create games which invite children to ponder on the beauty of our planet.
