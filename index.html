                    As the challenges of the climate crisis become ever clearer, we are also facing a Biodiversity Crisis. X% of our mammals, x% of our birds, and x% insects are under severe threat of extinction, with species having become extinct in the last decade alone.

                        Loosely based on Snakes and Ladders, this game is equally frustrating! Players move towards either a hotter, more damaged Earth, or a cooler, pleasant Earth, encountering different government and corporate policies along the way.   
                        <br/><br/>
                        A fun introduction to the idea that government and business decisions are crucial to helping our environment alongside the individual actions which children are more familiar with.

                        The warming stripes are an image that children will become increasingly familiar with - it's even being worm by Reading FC as part of their football kit - but do they know exactly what the stripes mean?
                        <br/><br/>
                        this activity will help them to understand and to explain the graphic, and they can also explpore Warming Stripes for different cities or countries using the University of Reading website.

                    I am a part-time primary school teacher, with experience of teaching both teaching KS1 and KS2, based in SW London. I love to combine the science from my Geography Degree with my passion for art to create games which invite children to think about the beauty of our planet.
